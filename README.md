# Python scripts to parse the CSV to JSON

To use the python scripts, just use the commandline and type `$ python states-csv-parse.py` or `$ python counties-csv-parse.py` to run the script. I found that for some reason there's an error that sometimes shows up in the county data script if I don't run it in Python 3, so for that just do `$ python3 states-csv-parse.py` or `$ python3 counties-csv-parse.py` if you have it available.
