        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p>
          The goal of this project was to give individuals a chance to view the various country and US state data available with the ability to see and compare various metrics. The idea was to allow for a more understanding ability to see how the various trends and totals mean in some level of context.
        </p>
        <p>There is a lot of hype and sensationalism about the pandemic and it is hard to understand what is real and what is hyperbole. The goal with this is to present the data and allow individuals to come to their own conclusions.</p>

      <hr />
      <div class="main__info">
        <h2>Data Processing</h2>
        <p>
          The data was ingested as csv files from the respective sources and
          processed for use on this site. The <strong>"Daily New Cases"</strong> and <strong></strong>"Daily New
          Deaths"</strong> metrics are calculated as the number of cases and deaths for
          that specific day. <strong>"Total Daily Cases"</strong> and <strong>"Total Daily Deaths"</strong> are
          calculated as a cumulative total of all of the previous days combined.
        </p>
        <p>
          The percentage calculations are based on the total populations for the
          respective country or state and the number of cases or deaths as a
          percentage of that total population number.

        <h2>Technical Information</h2>
        <p>
          This site is built using Javascript on a basic html site. There are many ways of doing this type of project and I know how to use a number of other Javascript frameworks, CSS frameworks, and other web development technologies. For this, I decided to simply use vanilla Javascript with <a href="chartjs.org/">Chart.JS</a> for the charting software. I built the styles using SASS compiled to CSS. The reason was to keep this simple. I didn't want to use a large React project, though that would have been something I'm very familiar with. I wanted to get this put together quickly and simply. There are a few <a href="https://www.python.org/">Pythong</a> scripts I use to process the data from csv to JSON then into a Javascript file for use on the site. Yes, there are probably more efficient ways to do that but the goal was quick and easy.
        </p>
        <p>Additional improvements will be made as time allows. If you have any interest in contributing to the site, feel free to visit the <a href="https://github.com/rlahoda/covid-19-data">Githup project page</a> to open an issue or create a pull request.</p>
